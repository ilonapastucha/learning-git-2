                I sit and wait - <br>
                Does an angel contemplate my fate? <br>
                And do they know <br>
                The places where we go? <br>
                When we're grey and old <br>
                'cuz I have been told <br>
                That salvation lets their wings unfold ...
            </p>
            <p class="center">
                So when I'm lying in my bed <br>
                Thoughts running through my head <br>
                And I feel the love is dead <br>
                I'm loving angels instead...
            </p>
            <p class="center">
                And through it all she offers me protection <br>
                A lot of love and affection <br>
                Whether I'm right or wrong <br>
                And down the waterfall <br>
                Wherever it may take me <br>
                I know that life won't break me <br>
                When I come to call she won't forsake me <br>
                I'm loving angels instead!
            </p>
            <p class="center">
                When I'm feeling weak <br>
                And my pain walks down a one way street <br>
                I look above <br>
                And I know I'll always be blessed with love <br>
                And as the feeling grows <br>
                She breathes flesh to my bones <br>
                And when love is dead <br>
                I'm loving angels instead
            </p>
            <p class="center">
                And through it all she offers me protection <br>
                A lot of love and affection <br>
                Whether I'm right or wrong <br>
                And down the waterfall <br>
                Wherever it may take me <br>
                I know that life won't break me <br>
                When I come to call she won't forsake me <br>
                I'm loving angels instead
